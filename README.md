# CQRS Book Library 

## Overview

This is my first attempt at a project that takes advantage of both CQRS and Event Sourcing, the 
domain is based around a simple book library where by members can loan books as long as they are not already out on loan.

I have purposly kept the domain simple in order to focus on CQRS and ES, therefore it does not directly model real life. I have used 
NUnit as the testing framework and used TDD in order to evolve the project I have opted to use both BDD style specifications and also normal unit tests to test the functionality.
